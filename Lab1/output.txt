Analysis of function: f(x) = (1 + sin(x)) * sin(x) - alpha - 3 * x + 5

Interval is [1.00, 2.00], alpha = 3.0
	sign for the left end:  +
	sign for the right end: -

Derivative = 2 * cos(x) * sin(x) + cos(x) - 3
	sign for the left end:  -
	sign for the right end: -
	minimum is in 2.00 and equals -4.17
	maximum is in 1.00 and equals -1.55

Second derivative = -2*sin^2(x) - sin(x) + 2 * cos^2(x)
	sign for the left end:  -
	sign for the right end: -

m = 1.55
M = 4.17

Phi = ((1 + sin(x)) * sin(x) - alpha + 5) / 3
	minimum is in 2.00 and equals -0.39
	maximum is in 1.00 and equals 0.48
